	abstract = {Making accurate predictions of corporate credit ratings is a crucial issue to both investors and rating agencies. In this paper, we investigate the determinants of market implied credit ratings in relation to financial factors, market-driven indicators and macroeconomic predictors. Applying a variable selection technique, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we document substantial predictive ability. In addition, when we compare our LASSO-selected models with the benchmark ordered probit model, we find that the former models have superior predictive power and outperform the latter model in all out-of-sample predictions.},

	abstract = {Although the corporate credit risk literature includes many studies modelling the change in the credit risk of corporate bonds over time, there has been far less analysis of the credit risk for portfolios of consumer loans. However, behavioural scores, which are calculated on a monthly basis by most consumer lenders, are the analogues of ratings in corporate credit risk. Motivated by studies of corporate credit risk, we develop a Markov chain model based on behavioural scores for establishing the credit risk of portfolios of consumer loans. Although such models have been used by lenders to develop models for the Basel Accord, nothing has been published in the literature on them. The model which we suggest differs in many respects from the corporate credit ones based on Markov chains --- such as the need for a second order Markov chain, the inclusion of economic variables and the age of the loan. The model is applied using data on a credit card portfolio from a major UK bank.},

@article{varin_overview,
	abstract = {A survey of recent developments in the theory and application of composite likelihood is provided, building on the review paper of Varin (2008). A range of application areas, including geostatistics, spatial extremes, and space-time models, as well as clustered and longitudinal data and time series are considered. The important area of applications to statistical genetics is omitted, in light of Larribe and Fearnhead (2011). Emphasis is given to the development of the theory, and the current state of knowledge on efficiency and robustness of composite likelihood inference.},
