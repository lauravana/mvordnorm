Title: Multivariate Models for Mixed Ordinal and Normal Responses in R.

Description: The R package mvord implements composite likelihood estimation in the class of multivariate ordinal regression models with probit and logit link. 
  A flexible modeling framework for multiple ordinal measurements on the same subject is set up, which takes into consideration the dependence among the multiple observations by employing different error structures. Heterogeneity in the error structure across the subjects can be accounted for by the package, which allows for covariate dependent error structures. In addition, regression coefficients and threshold parameters are varying across the multiple response dimensions in the default implementation. However, constraints can be defined by the user if a reduction of the parameter space is desired.
